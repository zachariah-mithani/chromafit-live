            <strong>TL;DR</strong>
            <p>Aim for <strong>0.7–1g of protein per pound of bodyweight</strong> (1.6–2.2g/kg) per day to maximize muscle building. At 180 lbs, that's 126–180g daily. Beginners can hit their ceiling at 0.7g/lb; advanced lifters benefit from the upper end. Total daily intake matters far more than timing.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Ask ten trainers how much protein you need to build muscle and you'll get ten different answers. Ask the research and the answer is clearer: <strong>0.7–1g per pound of bodyweight per day</strong> is the range where virtually all the benefit happens. Below it, muscle gain is suboptimal. Above it, you're spending money on protein your body will use for energy anyway.</p>
        <p>Here's what the research actually says, how to calculate your specific target, and the practical strategies to hit it without turning every meal into a math problem.</p>

        <h2>What the Research Actually Says</h2>
        <p>The most comprehensive meta-analysis on protein and muscle growth (Morton et al., 2018, reviewed 49 studies and 1,800 subjects) found that muscle protein synthesis plateaus at approximately <strong>1.62g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day</strong> — that's 0.73g per pound. Studies using higher intakes (up to 3.5g/kg) found no additional muscle building benefit beyond this ceiling.</p>
        <p>The practical range of 0.7–1g/lb exists for two reasons: individual variation (genetics, training age, total calorie intake) and measurement uncertainty (most nutrition databases have ±10–15% error margin). Aiming for 0.8–0.9g/lb gives you a comfortable buffer without dramatically overshooting.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>The formula:</strong> Your bodyweight in lbs × 0.8 = your daily protein target in grams. At 180 lbs, that's 144g. At 150 lbs, that's 120g.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Your Protein Target by Bodyweight</h2>

        <div class="protein-card">
            <div class="amount">~100g</div>
            <div class="desc"><h3>125 lbs (57 kg)</h3><p>0.8g/lb target. Achievable with 3–4 protein-focused meals per day.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="protein-card">
            <div class="amount">~145g</div>
            <div class="desc"><h3>180 lbs (82 kg)</h3><p>0.8g/lb target. 4 meals averaging 36g each, or 3 larger meals with a shake.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="protein-card">
            <div class="amount">~180g</div>
            <div class="desc"><h3>225 lbs (102 kg)</h3><p>0.8g/lb target. Requires deliberate planning at every meal.</p></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Does Protein Timing Matter?</h2>
        <p>Protein timing — specifically the "anabolic window" concept — was overhyped for decades. More recent research shows that <strong>total daily protein intake matters far more than when you eat it</strong>. Missing your post-workout shake won't meaningfully impact muscle growth if you hit your daily target.</p>
        <p>That said, spreading protein across 3–5 meals appears to optimize muscle protein synthesis (MPS) throughout the day better than consuming the same amount in 1–2 large meals. Each meal ideally contains 30–50g of protein to trigger a maximal MPS response.</p>

        <h2>How to Hit Your Protein Target Without Thinking About It</h2>
        <p>Most people fail to hit their protein target not because they don't know their number, but because they don't track consistently. The solution is building protein anchors — high-protein foods that form the base of every meal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken breast (6oz):</strong> ~50g protein, ~270 calories</li>
            <li><strong>Greek yogurt (1 cup):</strong> ~20g protein, ~150 calories</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs (2 whole + 3 whites):</strong> ~22g protein, ~190 calories</li>
            <li><strong>Salmon (6oz):</strong> ~40g protein, ~350 calories</li>
            <li><strong>Cottage cheese (1 cup):</strong> ~25g protein, ~200 calories</li>
            <li><strong>Whey protein shake:</strong> ~25g protein, ~130 calories</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Build your meals around one of these anchors and you'll consistently hit 30–40g per meal without tracking every ingredient from scratch.

        <h2>What About Cutting? Does Protein Change During a Deficit?</h2>
        <p>During a calorie deficit, protein needs actually <em>increase</em> compared to maintenance. When you're eating less, your body has less energy available and may catabolize muscle protein for fuel. Research suggests <strong>0.9–1.2g/lb during a cut</strong> to preserve muscle mass — higher than the standard maintenance recommendation.</p>
        <p>This is one reason high-protein diets are more effective for body recomposition than simply reducing calories: the protein preserves muscle while the deficit drives fat loss.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Calculate your target (bodyweight in lbs × 0.8), build your meals around a high-protein anchor at each sitting, and track your intake until the pattern becomes automatic. Your exact protein target will rarely be the limiting factor in your progress — <strong>consistency is</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much protein do I need to build muscle?</h3>
                <p>0.7–1g per pound of bodyweight per day (1.6–2.2g/kg). At 180 lbs, that's 126–180g daily. Aim for ~0.8g/lb as your baseline and adjust based on your results.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Does protein timing matter for muscle growth?</h3>
                <p>Less than most people think. Total daily protein intake matters far more than timing. Spreading protein across 3–5 meals is slightly better than 1–2 large meals, but missing your post-workout window won't noticeably impact results.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens if you eat too much protein?</h3>
                <p>Excess protein is used for energy or stored — it doesn't build additional muscle above the ~1.62g/kg ceiling. High protein intake (up to 3g/kg) is safe for healthy people, but the practical cost is calorie displacement from carbs and fats.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I eat more protein when cutting?</h3>
                <p>Yes. During a calorie deficit, increase protein to 0.9–1.2g/lb to protect muscle mass from catabolism. Higher protein intake during cuts helps preserve muscle while fat is lost.</p>
